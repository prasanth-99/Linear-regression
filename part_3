#Separating Our Data
#Now that we've trimmed our data set down we need to separate it into 4 arrays. 
#However, before we can do that we need to define what attribute we are trying to predict. 
#This attribute is known as a label. The other attributes that will determine our label are known as features.
#Once we've done this we will use numpy to create two arrays. One that contains all of our features and one that contains our labels.


predict = "G3"

X = np.array(data.drop([predict], 1)) # Features
y = np.array(data[predict]) # Labels
#After this we need to split our data into testing and training data. 
#We will use 90% of our data to train and the other 10% to test. 
#The reason we do this is so that we do not test our model on data that it has already seen.

x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.1)
