#Importing Modules/Packages
#Before we start coding we should import all of the following.

import pandas as pd
import numpy ads np
import sklearn
from sklearn import linear_model
from sklearn.utils import shuffle
#Loading in Our Data
#Once you've downloaded the data set and placed it into your main directory you can load it in using the pandas module.

data = pd.read_csv("student-mat.csv", sep=";")
# Since our data is seperated by semicolons we need to do sep=";"
#To see our data frame we can type:

print(data.head())
#This will print out the first 5 students in our data frame.
