#Implementing the Algorithm
#Now that we understand how linear regression works we can use it to predict students final grades.

#We will start by defining the model which we will be using.

linear = linear_model.LinearRegression()
#Next we will train and score our model using the arrays we created in the previous tutorial.

linear.fit(x_train, y_train)
acc = linear.score(x_test, y_test) # acc stands for accuracy 
#To see how well our algorithm performed on our test data we can print out the accuracy.

print(acc)
#For this specific data set a score of above 80% is fairly good.
